Sunday, August 9th UPDATE:
Sorry for the delay.  I just gave this talk again at eRubyCon.

Some of these stateful workflow ideas are being used in a project for the
DC Public School System, but the data store there is unconventional (a
QuickBase database online), so the work being done on StonePath has taken a
back seat.  I expect this project to be live again shortly, starting simply
with some wiki entries explaining the same concepts that I outline in the
presentation (including WorkItem, Ownership, Assignment, Task, Permissions, and
organizational modeling with groups and roles).

---

This is a Stateful Workflow gem that is currently being pulled out of a 
real-world client project.  I'm creating the repository before RailsConf 2009
so interested people that attend my talk can watch and contribute.

I'm also asking you to keep me honest - this extraction is real, but is likely
to take a back seat to real billable client time.  If I know there is interest
(that is, if I see followers and if they nag me), this project is likely to get
time over others.
