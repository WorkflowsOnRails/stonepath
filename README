This is a Stateful Workflow gem that is currently being pulled out of a 
real-world client project.  I'm creating the repository before RailsConf 2009
so interested people that attend my talk can watch and contribute.

I'm also asking you to keep me honest - this extraction is real, but is likely
to take a back seat to real billable client time.  If I know there is interest
(that is, if I see followers and if they nag me), this project is likely to get
time over others.
